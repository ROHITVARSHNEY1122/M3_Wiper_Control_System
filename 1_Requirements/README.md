# INTRODUCTION

## RESEARCH
This application is researched from various sources (like you tube , google and research papers ) and then I have modified into successful working model application of wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers. 

### Who
-   Everyone who wants safety and clear vision of road in driving using motor vehicles.
### What
-   Wiper Control System for motor vehicles.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you understand the importance of safety management and start to be accountable for your health during driving motor vehicles in unfavourable weather conditions.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their safety and  generate better results in life during travelling via motor vehicles  .
### How
-   LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original position after cleaning windsheet of motor vehicles  .
