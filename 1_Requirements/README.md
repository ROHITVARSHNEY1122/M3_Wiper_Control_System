# INTRODUCTION

## RESEARCH
This application is researched from various sources (like you tube , google and research papers ) and then I have modified into successful working model application of wiper control system.

### Who
-   Everyone who wants to have a eye track on time .
### What
-   Time with digital output showing system.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you understand the importance of time management and start to be accountable for your time.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their time and  generate better results in life .
### How
-   By using Atmega328p microcontroller for controlling and we program it and then we have to load firmware in elf or hex format in simulation software called  SimulIDE .
